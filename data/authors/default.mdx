### Who am I?
Hi, I'm Carter Speerschneider—a software engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of South Florida. I'm an active member of the Society of Software Engineers (SSE), where I explore building full-stack applications and learning about the latest technologies.

### Passions
Before college, I was drawn to programming and mathematics, which led me to choose Computer Science as my major. One of my favorite courses has been Discrete Mathematics, thanks to its focus on theorems and proofs. I consider myself an abstract thinker, which helps me approach practical problems with creativity and logic.
I spend my time honing my skills in algorithms and data structures through platforms like LeetCode. This experience reshaped how I tackle complex challenges and strengthened my problem-solving mindset. My goal is to apply these skills to make a meaningful impact in the software industry—building systems, applications, and tools that people love to use.
