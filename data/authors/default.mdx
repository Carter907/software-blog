### Who am I?
Hi, I'm Carter Speerschneider—a software engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of South Florida. I'm an active member of the Whitehatters Computer Science Club (WCSC), where I explore different security paradigms, best practices, and networking.

### Passions
Before college, I was drawn to programming and mathematics, which led me to choose Computer Science as my major. One of my favorite courses has been Discrete Mathematics, thanks to its focus on theorems and proofs. I enjoy thinking abstractly about complex problems which makes different topics interesting.
I spend my time honing my skills in algorithms and data structures through platforms like LeetCode. I also spent a lot of time reading about fundamental CS topics like operating systems and computer architecture. This experience reshaped how I tackle complex challenges and strengthened my problem-solving mindset.
 My goal is to apply my love of the C++ programming language and computer architectural knowledge toward the defense or high performance sector of the Greater Tampa Bay Area.
